There are several examples and scripts to help you start with Clupatra

 - steering files in ./examples

   clupa.xml, clupa_ild01.xml
      - do patrec and display result in CED

   clupa_ana.xml 
      - pattern recognition in batch
      - creates ClupatraTrackSegments
                ClupatraTracks

   trkeff.xml
     - create root file with histos for track finding efficiencies

   fit_view_TBdata_3modules.xml
     - fit the data and draw the hits/tracks using CEDViewer. It also requires gearfile.xml (included)
       to set the geometry (note the magnetic field Z component is NOT zero!).
       If you switch off the viewers and uncomment the LCIOoutput processor, you get a regular fitting example file.
       For comparison also a pathfinder example processor is included, but its parameters are
       not guaranteed to be perfect for your application. Please consult the relevant developers for
       more information.
       Note: Take care that you use the correct geometry file for your application!
       Note-2: Be sure that you draw the tracks at needed states. You might need to draw the Clupatra tracks
       at the first hit but to draw Pathfinder tracks from the default track state (probably 
       somewhere along the beam position). If you need to draw tracks at different states for both track finders
       (e.g. default track state of PathFinder and AtFirstHit for Clupatra),
       you need two MyILDViewer-s processors in the steering file (as in the present version) and
       if you want to draw the tracks as same states (e.g. default) you may combine it into one single viewer processor
       by only changing the collections to be displayed (via DrawInLayer parameter)


    trkeff.C
     - make nice plots for Clupatra, LEPTracking and FullLDCTracking
